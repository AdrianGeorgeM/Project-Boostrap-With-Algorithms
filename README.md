# 🍳 Project Les Petits Plats: Bootstrap with Algorithms 

## Overview

Welcome to **Les Petits Plats**, an innovative website designed for users to search and discover recipes. This project aims to create a high-fidelity prototype for the website, featuring a robust search functionality. A comprehensive mockup and a JSON dataset containing 50 recipes were provided to simulate the database structure.

## Developed Skills

Throughout the course of this project, the following skills have been honed:

- Analyzing computational problems to identify efficient and effective solutions. 🎯
- Developing and implementing advanced algorithms to power the recipe search functionality. 🔍

## Objectives

### Content

🎨 Crafting a user-friendly and visually appealing interface using **Bootstrap**.
🔍 Implementing a powerful and intuitive search functionality.

### Search Functionality

To achieve these objectives, the following milestones have been accomplished:

#### Preparation

📋 Creating an **Investigation Form** to compare and evaluate two search algorithms, determining the most recommended choice.
⏱️ Conducting comprehensive performance tests to measure the number of operations per second for optimal efficiency.
📊 Designing **UML Activity Diagrams** to visualize the core search algorithms and the entire search functionality, encompassing main search and keyword search processes.

#### Details

The search functionality allows users to filter recipes based on two key axes:

1. 🔍 **Main Search**: The user initiates the search by entering at least 3 characters in the main search bar. The system then scours the database for recipes that match the user's input in recipe titles, ingredient lists, or recipe descriptions. The interface promptly updates with the search results, displaying the initial matches as they become available.

2. 🔑 **Keyword Search**: Users can further refine their search using advanced search fields, such as ingredients, utensils, or devices. As users input their search criteria, irrelevant keywords dynamically disappear, streamlining the search process for enhanced efficiency. The search results are then updated accordingly, presenting an intersection of matching recipes. For instance, if the user adds the tags "coconut" and "chocolate" to the ingredients, they will receive recipes that contain both coconut and chocolate.

## Requirements

To ensure a seamless and top-notch user experience, the project adheres to the following requirements:

- The HTML and CSS code must pass **W3C validation** without any errors.
- The website must be fully **responsive**, offering a consistent experience across various devices. 📱💻
- **ESLint** is employed to maintain clean and consistent JavaScript code.
- The user interface is meticulously developed using **Bootstrap 4**. 🎉
- The JavaScript implementation of the search engine does not rely on any external libraries.

## Challenges & Achievements

Throughout the project, we encountered and successfully tackled various challenges, leading to significant achievements:

🚀 **Module Organization**: We efficiently utilized **modules** to structure and manage JavaScript code, elevating code maintainability and readability.

We are thrilled to present Les Petits Plats, a website that empowers users to explore an extensive collection of delightful recipes through a user-friendly and highly efficient search functionality. Embark on a delightful culinary journey with Les Petits Plats! 🍽️🥗🍝
